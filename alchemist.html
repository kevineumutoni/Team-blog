        <article class="main-idea">
            <h1 class="main-title">Personal Legend</h1>
            <p>A personal legend is something that people most deeply want,which requires a willingness to leave behind
                what’s comfortable ,trust in yourself and the language of the universe to achieve it which in return
                will
                bring fulfillment and happiness.</p>
            <p>“The only thing that concerned the sheep were food and water…they trust me,and they have forgotten how to
                rely on their own Instincts,because I lead them to nourishment,”says Santiago on page 7.</p>
            <p>The sheep in a way symbolize society who are content with their current predictable life and don’t want
                to
                pursue their dreams. Most of the people in our society would prefer to be in their comfort zone rather
                than
                finding their destinies which would require much effort to put in .</p>
            <p>There are people like Santiego as well who question their own contentment and desires and seek life to be
                more than just a routine.</p>
            <p>Example: For young people today,the pressure to conform to traditional career paths(law,medicine,finance)
                often clashes with the desire for purpose-driven work.The rise of social media influencers,YouTubers in
                some
                content showcases generations seeking for a path aligned with their passion.However it also highlights
                the
                struggle many young people face in identifying their “legend”.The fear of making the “wrong ” choice or
                deviating from established norm can be really scary as Santiego’s initial hesitation.</p>

        <article class="main-idea">
            <h1 class="main-title">Embracing Change</h1>
            <p> Personal growth often requires letting go of old beliefs ,adapting to new situations,and trusting in the
                uncertain future.Santiago's journey is a very good example of embracing change.He leaves his familiar
                life,abandons his initial plans,and adapts to new environments and situations,learning valuable lessons
                along the way.</p>
            <p>This really relates with the youth of this generation where it is hard to make changes and really is
                tempting
                to stay in comfort zone being scared of the unknown.</p>
            <p>“Now I can see that, it hasn’t been too bad.The is exactly the size I always wanted it to be.I don’t want
                to
                change anything because I don’t know how to deal with change .I am used to the way I am ” says the
                crystal
                merchant on page 52 indicating there exist many people in our society who are afraid of the uncertain
                future
                that holds them back from exploring the world and fulfilling their destiny.</p>

            <h1 class="main-title"> Journey vs destination</h1>
            <p>
                The journey of the boy Santiago begins when he decides to become a shepherd and pursue his traveling desire. 
                He gets a recurring dream of treasure at the pyramids in Egypt. The journey to his destination is filled with adventure, challenges and life lessons. 
                It was on his journey that Santiago got to interact with a crystal merchant and he gained insights on crystals. On his way to the desert, he meets an Englishman
                 who lends him books on alchemy which he read through but could not grasp the context of alchemy until he met with an Alchemist. Santiago landed in the oasis due
                  to a war that was occurring in the desert. On his stay there, he fell in love, became an advisor and was able to interpret the language of the universe as well
                   as meet with the Alchemist. The Alchemist helped him reach his destination after successfully overcoming various obstacles. By the time Santiago reached the pyramids, 
                   he was able to speak the language of the universe and he could  turn himself into wind. When he reached his destination, it dawned on him that all along his treasure
                    was back home where he had his second dream. To realize his destination, Santiago took on a journey that taught him patience, perseverance and resilience.
