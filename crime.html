            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Born a Crime</strong> is Trevor Noah's remarkable story of growing up in South Africa during and
                after apartheid. The book chronicles his experiences as a mixed-race child in a country where his very
                existence was illegal, his complex relationship with his fearless mother, and his journey to find his
                place in a divided world.</p>
            <p>This alternative title captures the essence of Trevor Noah's experience living between racial categories
                during apartheid. "Liminal" refers to the transitional space between two states - perfectly describing
                Trevor's position as someone who didn't fit neatly into any of apartheid's rigid racial classifications.
                The title maintains the legal implication of his birth being a "crime" while emphasizing the ongoing
                identity struggle that defines his story.</p>

                <div id="personal-reflection" class="hide">
                    <h3>Instance one: When Trevor went to school at H.A Jack primary school.</h3>
                    <p> First he was taken to 'A class', in which almost all of them were white,
                        then on the playground he met alot of black kids but he had known to speak their different
                        languages
                        and so it got easier tointeract
                        with them. Trevor says “Suddenly I knew who my people were and I wanted to be with them”(pg.58).
                        “I'd
                        never had to choose, but when I was forced to choose, I chose black. The world saw me as colored
                        but
                        I
                        didn't spend my life looking at myself but at the people who surrounded me, and that is how I
                        saw
                        myself(pg. 59)”. When he realized that all the black kids were put in a separate class,, he
                        chose to
                        identify with them rather than the white students in his class. Trevor goes back and forth with
                        the
                        school counselor about switching classes and he was not convinced to stay in the white class
                        despite
                        the
                        counselor telling him that choosing to leave A class would have a great impact on his future.
                        Here,
                        Trevor exudes a strong sense of identity by choosing to identify with the black kids despite his
                        skin
                        color. When he spoke with them in the different languages, the other students felt like he
                        belonged
                        with
                        them and they welcomed him in their groups.
                        In our society today, many people choose to associate themselves with the majority and they end
                        up
                        losing themselves when they are trying to fit in. Trevor Noah teaches us not to compromise our
                        identity
                        just because whichever group you associate with is seen at a different light.

            <h3> Instance two: When Trevor was in high school at Sandringham.</h3>
            <p> During break, when they are on the playground, Trevor finds himself as the only mixed kid out of
                a
                thousand. He says “I wasn't a natural constituent of any particular group”(pg 138). Having a
                strong
                sense of identity, Trevor finds ways to maneuver through school life and he finds his niche
                which
                helps
                him learn to move seamlessly through groups and blend in easily. In addition, Trevor states that
                outsiders have a choice to either be anonymous/ invisible or choose to protect themselves by
                opening
                up.

                Some cultures in society work towards being accepted for everything that they are which can lead
                them to
                feel like outsiders. The reality of things is that they don't have to be accepted for
                everything,
                but
                only one part of themselves that they are willing to share.</p>

                    you experienced being an outsider? How did you cope or adapt? </h2>
                <p> Trevor's skin color made him an outsider. He was either too black to be white or too white to be
                    black.
                    He says “Other colored people hated me because of my whiteness” pg (121). He was not liked by the
                    black
                    people since he was white and was also not liked by the white people since he was black. Trevor uses
                    humor to fit in. In every group he went to during the breaks he used humor to connect and talk to
                    the
                    group even if it was for a short while, So generally how to cope is to Identify your niche,
                    something to
                    help you cope in such a situation. Voice out your feelings. And Dissociate with people who make you
                    feel
                    invisible.

                    does this reflect the concept of family as a shield? Compared to real-life examples. </h2>
                <p>
                    Patricia constantly navigates the constraints of apartheid and societal expectations to provide
                    Trevor
                    with opportunities and protection. She breaks rules to ensure Trevor has a good education, even if
                    it
                    means sending him to schools in different neighborhoods. She lies about Trevor's father to avoid the
                    consequences of their mixed-race relationship. These actions are driven by her desire to protect
                    Trevor
                    and give him a better life, reflecting family as a shield against adversity.

                    Patricia's willingness to bend rules to protect Trevor demonstrators demonstrates any mother's
                    willingness to defy society norms for their child's safety and future.

                <h2>4. Patriarchy & Resistance: What commentary does the book make about masculinity
                    and gender power structures? How do characters respond? </h2>
                <p>
                    The book highlights the ways masculinity is constructed and enforced, and how these structures
                    impact
                    family dynamics and societal norms. Characters like Patricia, Abel, respond in various ways, some
                    resisting the patriarchal expectations while others navigate and internalize them. The book exposes
                    the
                    rigid expectations of traditional masculinity, where men are expected to be dominant and
                    controlling,
                    often leading to abusive behavior. Abel, Patricia's husband, embodies this, with his desire for
                    control
                    and his violent outbursts when faced with Patricia's independence. Abel's insecurities and
                    dependence on
                    alcohol are presented as examples of how patriarchy can trap men in harmful patterns of behavior.
                <h3>Character Responses</h3>
                <p>
                    Patricia embodies resistance by rejecting traditional gender roles and asserting her independence.
                    She
                    refuses to be controlled by Abel and actively seeks her path.
                    Abel represents the internal struggles of men within a patriarchal system. His attempts to exert
                    control
                    over Patricia and his inability to handle his emotions highlight the constraints of traditional
                    masculinity.
                    Also, we have the bus driver who challenges Patricia for traveling without a man or the police
                    officers
                    who fail to acknowledge Patricia's abuse.

                <h2>5. Identity: Given vs Chosen : How does Trevor's life reflect the tension between
                    assigned identity and self-definition? </h2>
                <h3>Assigned Identity:</h3>
                <p>
                    As a mixed-race South African child, Trevor was born into a system that rigidly categorized people
                    based
                    on race and ethnicity. This system, enforced by the apartheid regime, defined his place in society
                    as
                    "colored," a status that placed him between Black and white, with different rights and privileges.
                    This
                    assigned identity had a significant impact on his childhood and daily life, as it determined where
                    he
                    could live, attend school, and even how he was treated by others.
                <h3>Self-Definition:</h3>
                <p>Despite the limitations imposed by his assigned identity, Trevor actively sought to define himself.
                    He
                    describes himself as a "chameleon," adept at adapting to different social circles and drawing from
                    various aspects of his identity to connect with others.This choice to navigate different social
                    spaces
                    highlights his agency in shaping his own identity, rather than simply accepting the label imposed on
                    him.

                    His mother gave him a unique name with no particular meaning in South Africa that cut ties with the
                    cultural norms. This gives Trevor a chance to choose and define his own identity.
                    Patricia's actions are always guided by her desire to ensure Trevor's success and well-being. She
                    teaches him resilience, encourages him to think for himself, and provides him with opportunities
                    that
                    most children in their circumstances would not have.</p>
